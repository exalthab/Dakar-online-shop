Using no CDN. Avantages, 
I can work on the project on my computer 
and see the progress, 
in case there is no Internet connection.

STEPS TO SETTING UP

Step1. Creation of html file
Step2. Creation of images folder. This folder will hold all images downloaded from unsplash webpage or picked from camera.
Step3. Download a standalone Tailwindcss from GitHub (eg. Ver 4.0 ) and locate the one compatible with Windows. i.e tailwindcss64.exe. This must be into the project folder.
Step4.Extract the folder to the path of the project (i.e landingpage-shop)
Step5. Rename the download and unzipped folder and rename it to “tailwind.exe” 
Step6. Create folder called “src”
Step7. Inside the folder src, create a file called “input.css”
Step8. Inside the file input.css : write the following
@import “tailwindcss”;
Step9. Creat a file name it “tailwind.config.js
Step10. Inside the file, write the following code:
	module.exports = {
    content: ["./index.html"],  // Tell Tailwind where are the classes
    theme: {
      extend: {
        colors:{
            brand:"", // Custom color for the header/brand
        }
      }
    },
    plugins: [],
  };
  
Step11.With Vscode, open the terminal then launch Git Bash.
Step12. Run the following code>
./tailwindcss.exe -i ./src/input.css -o ./dist/output.css –watch
This code will create the “dist” folder. Inside this folder, it will generate an “output.css” file.
Step12. Go to index.html head and create a link that goes to the tailwind css.
Step 13. Go live and test the landing page using different screen’s devices.
N.B: Each time there is a change in the project input.css file, the command on step12 has a pupose to update automatically the output.css accordingly
Step.14. The styles.css file is optional  
Step.15. Create a documentation folder


Notice:
While trying to load file to GitHub, It wasn't be possible.
remote: error: File tailwindcss.exe is 138.13 MB; this exceeds GitHub's file size limit of 100.00 MB

That is why, the use of option 2 is an alternative.
by disactivating the link in index.html.
  <!-- <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script> : This is an online Tailwind CSS mode -->
Hence , I have to delete the file tailwindcss.exe.
